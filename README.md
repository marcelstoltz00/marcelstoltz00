- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcelstoltz00
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer science and the inner and outer workings of software development and what it encompasses.
-  I've only worked with Delphi and some HTML but i'm looking forward to broaden my coding knowledge
- I'm still figuring out what specifically i want to do with my life and what parts of Comp Sci/IT i enjoy the most.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Gr12 Student but the plan is to go study bsc Computer Science if everything goes well :)
