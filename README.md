Hi, I’m @marcelstoltz00
 I’m a Gr12 student interested in Computer science and the inner and outer workings of software development and what it encompasses.
 I've only worked with Delphi and some HTML but i'm looking forward to broaden my coding knowledge.
 I'm still figuring out what specifically i want to do with my life and what parts of Comp Sci/IT i enjoy the most.
My goal is to get a degree in Computer Science and find what i love to do in tech :)
